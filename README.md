# Pandas_Book
This repository includes my notes in the form of jupyter notes in which I have explained everything that I understood from the book Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney.

## How to read: 
I have given a nice and neat way to exaplain things throughout the notebooks. Each of them are divided into seperate folders with the consistant file namings. And I have written in such a way which will make you understand the approach that I am taking to understand the topic of solving problems.

## Please, pardon my dust:
I have used some inappropriate words when some new thing appeared or some code snipped excited me. I like to present my excitement or the mood of that time while understaning that topic. So please read with care.

## The books:
Books are written in an incremental way, so from the first cell you can read & understand the code and execute in the chronological manner. No need to find some peice of data from anywhere else.

**REMEMBER** to clone the repository. I have made a nice graphic in starting of each notebook with text. ***Which is not visible*** in the preview in GitHub. Clonning anf running in your local machine will make it visible and more worth of my time.

Thanks, <br>
