# üêºPandas Book
This repository includes my notes in the form of jupyter notes in which I have explained everything that I understood from the book Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney.

## ü§ì How to read: 
I have given a **nice and neat** way to exaplain things throughout the notebooks. Each of them are *divided into seperate folders* with the consistant file namings. And I have written in such a way which will *make you understand the approach* that I am taking to understand the topic of solving problems.

## üî† Please, pardon my dust:
I have used some ***inappropriate words*** when some new thing appeared or some code snippet excited me. I like to present my excitement or the mood of that time while understaning that topic. So please **read with care**.

## üìö The books:
Books are written in an *incremental* way, so from the first cell you can read & understand the code and execute in the chronological manner. No need to find some peice of data from anywhere else.

**REMEMBER** to clone the repository. I have made a **nice graphic** in starting of each notebook with text. ***Which is not visible*** in the preview in GitHub. Clonning and running in your local machine will make it visible and more worth of my time. *or render online and view [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AayushSameerShah/Pandas_Book/tree/main/).*

Thanks, <br>
